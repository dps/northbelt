This directory contains EAGLE files for the schematic and PCB layout of the motor carrier boards.

The components (x2) for the motor board can be found in the mouser saved project located at http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=1ebce4eb52

The PCB is available to order as a shared project on OSHPark at https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/lNbIvA7q .  Orders at OSHPark are in multiples of 3 so order 6x to get 18 boards for 16 points of the compass.
